# Locus Map Tasker Plugin

This is a [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/) plugin for [Locus Map](https://www.locusmap.app) application.

It was created to solve very special customization needs which could not get into Locus Map.

# Installation

The project setup was made with Android Studio and run's best there.

# Usage

After installation you will find this App at Tasker in the plugin section.

## Example configuration

I did create some Tasker example profiles and screen for common use-cases:

- [Remaining elevation to target](https://github.com/Falcosc/locus-addon-tasker/wiki/Examples#remaining-elevation-to-target-as-dashboard-overlay) - as dashboard overlay
- [Center Map to GPS on move](https://github.com/Falcosc/locus-addon-tasker/wiki/Examples#center-map-to-gps-on-move)
